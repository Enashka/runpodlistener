# ComfyUI Image Sync Tool
*Maintained by Enashka*

A simple tool to automatically sync images generated by ComfyUI on RunPod to Google Drive.

## Features

- Monitors the ComfyUI output directory for new images
- Automatically uploads new images to a specified Google Drive folder
- Runs in the background as a service
- Simple installation and setup
- Configurable via config.yaml file

## Installation on RunPod

### Prerequisites

1. A Google Cloud project with the Google Drive API enabled
2. OAuth 2.0 credentials (credentials.json) for the Google Drive API
3. A Google Drive folder ID where images will be uploaded

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

For a simplified setup process, you can use our setup script:

1. Connect to your RunPod instance via SSH or the web terminal

2. Download and run the setup script:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enashka/runpodlistener/main/setup_sync.sh
   chmod +x setup_sync.sh
   ./setup_sync.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter your Google Drive folder ID when asked
   - Upload your credentials.json file when prompted
   - Complete the Google authentication process

The script will automatically:
- Create the necessary directory
- Download all required files
- Install dependencies
- Configure your folder ID
- Guide you through authentication
- Start the sync service

### Manual Installation Steps

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your RunPod instance via SSH or the web terminal

2. Create a directory for the sync tool:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /workspace/runpodlistener
   cd /workspace/runpodlistener
   ```

3. Download the sync script:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enashka/runpodlistener/main/minimal_sync.py
   chmod +x minimal_sync.py
   ```

4. Download the configuration file:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enashka/runpodlistener/main/config.yaml
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pydrive2 python-dotenv pyyaml
   ```

6. Upload your credentials.json file to this directory (you can use the RunPod file browser)

7. Edit the config.yaml file to set your Google Drive folder ID:
   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_FOLDER_ID with your actual Google Drive folder ID
   sed -i 's/YOUR_FOLDER_ID/your_actual_folder_id/' config.yaml
   ```

8. Run the script once to authenticate:
   ```bash
   python minimal_sync.py --once
   ```
   
   Follow the authentication link provided, sign in with your Google account, and paste the verification code back into the terminal.

9. Create a start script:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enashka/runpodlistener/main/start.sh
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```

10. Start the sync service:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

## Configuration

The tool can be configured by editing the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Google Drive folder ID where images will be uploaded
folder_id: "YOUR_FOLDER_ID"

# Sync interval in seconds
sync_interval: 5  # Check for new files every 5 seconds

# ComfyUI output directory
output_directory: "/workspace/ComfyUI/output"

# File extensions to sync
file_extensions:
  - ".png"
  - ".jpg"
  - ".jpeg"
```

You can modify these settings to change:
- The Google Drive folder where images are uploaded
- How frequently the tool checks for new files
- Which directory to monitor for new images
- Which file extensions to sync

## Usage

The sync tool will run in the background and automatically upload new images from the ComfyUI output directory to your specified Google Drive folder.

To check the logs:
```bash
tail -f sync.log
```

To stop the service:
```bash
pkill -f minimal_sync.py
```

## Getting Your Google Drive Folder ID

1. Navigate to the folder in Google Drive where you want to upload images
2. The folder ID is the last part of the URL:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID
   ```

## Getting Google Drive API Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Drive API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application)
